# Hey, I'm Austin

Staff Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience building full-stack web applications, cloud-native backends, and the occasional robot. I've shipped browser extensions, mobile apps, AI-native products, and revenue-generating APIs — and I've led the teams behind them.

Currently building with AI-native architectures and working across the AWS ecosystem. I like solving hard infrastructure problems and turning proof-of-concepts into production systems.

**Maker** — 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC, and woodworking. I like building things I can hold.\
**Electronics** — Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32 — home automation, sensors, and whatever else I can wire up.\
